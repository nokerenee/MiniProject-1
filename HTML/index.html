            <img class="display-photo" src="../Assets/display-photo.png" alt="debugging display photo"/>
            <p>Debugging is the art of identifying and resolving &#128030&#128027&#128029 in your software.</p>
            <h3>Common reasons for bugs include:</h3>
            <div class="m-20 flex-container flex-center h-150 background-1">
                <ul>
                    <li>Incorrect logic</li>
                    <!-- An error in a program's source code that gives way to unanticipated and erroneous behavior. 
                    A logic error is classified as a type of runtime error that can result in a program producing an incorrect output. 
                    It can also cause the program to crash when running. -->
                    <li>Syntax errors</li>
                    <!-- Syntax errors are mistakes in the source code, such as spelling and punctuation errors, incorrect labels, and so on, which cause an error message to be generated by the compiler. -->
                    <li>Unexpected input</li>
                    <!-- Unexpected input is normally the result of a syntax error resulting from careless typing. -->
                    <li>Race conditions</li>
                    <!-- Race conditions occur when two computer program processes, or threads, attempt to access the same resource at the same time and cause problems in the system. Race conditions are considered a common issue for multithreaded applications. -->
                    <li>Memory leaks</li>
                    <!-- A memory leak is a type of resource leak that occurs when a computer program incorrectly manages memory allocations in such a way that memory which is no longer needed is not released. A memory leak may also happen when an object is stored in memory but cannot be accessed by the running code. -->
                </ul>
            </div>
            <h3>Types of Debugging:</h3>
            <div class="m-20 flex-container flex-center h-100 background-2">
                <ul>
                    <li>Console debugging</li>
                    <!-- console is a text-based interface that allows you to interact with the computer's operating system or run code. -->
                    <li>IDE level debugging</li>
                    <!-- IDE: integrated development environments is a software application that helps programmers develop software code efficiently (ex: VS). -->
                    <li>Browser level debugging</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <h3>Debugging typically involves the following steps:</h3>
            <div class="m-20 flex-container flex-center h-250 background-3">
                <ol>
                    <li>Identifying the Issue</li>
                    <!-- The first step is recognizing that there's a problem. This might be evident through incorrect results, crashes, unexpected behaviors, or error messages. -->
                    <li>Reproducing the Issue</li>
                    <!-- To effectively debug a problem, you need to be able to reproduce it consistently. This might involve setting up test cases or scenarios that trigger the issue reliably. -->
                    <li>Isolating the Problem</li>
                    <!-- Narrow down the scope of the issue. Determine whether the problem is related to a specific piece of code, module, or function. -->
                    <li>Using Debugging Tools</li>
                    <!-- Modern programming environments provide tools to help debug code. These include breakpoints, step-by-step execution, watches, variable inspection, call stacks, and more. -->
                    <li>Examining the Code</li>
                    <!-- Carefully review the code around the suspected issue. Check for logical errors, incorrect calculations, unexpected behavior of functions, etc. -->
                    <li>Logging and Print Statements</li>
                    <!-- Inserting log messages or print statements in strategic places can help trace the flow of execution and identify where things might be going wrong. -->
                    <li>Testing Hypothesis</li>
                    <!-- Formulate hypotheses about what might be causing the issue and test each one systematically. -->
                    <li>Fixing the Issue</li>
                    <!-- Once you've identified the root cause of the problem, implement the necessary fixes, whether it's correcting logic, adjusting parameters, or refactoring code. -->
                    <li>Testing the Fix</li>
                    <!-- After making changes, thoroughly test the program to ensure that the issue has been resolved and that no new issues have been introduced. -->
                    <li>Documenting the Solution</li>
                    <!-- It's important to document the problem, the steps taken to debug and fix it, and any insights gained from the experience. This helps in future troubleshooting and collaboration. -->
                </ol>
            </div>
            <p>Debugging is an iterative process that requires <strong>patience</strong>, <strong>attention to detail</strong>, and <strong>problem-solving skills</strong>. It's an integral part of the software development lifecycle and is essential for creating robust and reliable software systems.</p>
            <h3>Debugging demystified</h3>
            <p>Basic debugging can be done using console logs:</p>
            <div class="m-20 flex-container flex-center h-150 background-1">
                <table>
                    <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Console level</th>
                        <th>Description</th>
                    </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <td>console.debug()</td>
                            <td>Outputs a message to the console with the log level debug</td>
                            </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>console.info()</td>
                            <td>Used to output message which provide information, such as “server started”</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>console.warn()</td>
                            <td>Used to display warnings</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>console.error()</td>
                            <td>Used to output an error message. You may use string substitution and additional arguments with this method</td>
